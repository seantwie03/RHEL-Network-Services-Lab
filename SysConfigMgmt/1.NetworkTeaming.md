## Procedure

- Create the team connection

      nmcli con add type team con-name <TEAM_NAME> ifname <TEAM_NAME> config '<JSON_CONFIG>'

- Assign a static IP address to the team

      nmcli con mod <TEAM_NAME> ipv4.addresses <IPv4_ADDRESS>/<CIDR>
      nmcli con mod <TEAM_NAME> ipv4.method manual

- Add network devices to the team

      *Note: Do this for each device that needs to be added to the team.
      nmcli con add type ethernet con-name <TEAM_NAME>-<PORT_NUMBER> ifname <INTERFACE_NAME> master <TEAM_NAME>

- Ensure no other connections using those devices

      *Note: Do this for each device that was added to the team.
      nmcli con down <INTERFACE_NAME>

- Enable slave connections

      *Note: Do this for each device that was added to the team.
      nmcli con up <TEAM_NAME>-<PORT_NUMBER>

- Enable team connection

      nmcli con up <TEAM_NAME>


- Verify team status

      teamdctl <TEAM_NAME> state
      nmcli con show <TEAM_NAME>
